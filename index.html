				<h1>Who I am</h1>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Yi Fan Song, currently studying for a Bachelors of
					Mathematics at the
					<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
					I'm from Xi'an, China, and I love the food from my hometown,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangpi">凉皮</a>,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paomo">羊肉泡馍</a>,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roujiamo">肉夹馍</a>,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi_cuisine"
						>etc.</a
					>.

				<h1>Things I do</h1>
				<p>
					Most of the code I've written are for the backend, but I've
					done a lot of frontend in the past, my interest mostly lies
					in backend, so that's what my own projects have mostly been
					about, either that or it was some tool to solve some trivial
					problem for myself.
				</p>
				<div>
					<h2>A non-exhaustive list of things I've learned</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Programming languages: Typescript, Golang, SQL,
							Python, Lua, PHP, HTML, CSS
						</li>
						<li>
							Frameworks: ReactJs, React Native, Angular, Express
						</li>
						<li>
							Libraries: OpenCV, Scikit-image, Firebase, DiscordJs
						</li>
						<li>Misc: Docker, Nginx, REST</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Refer to my
						<a href="https://github.com/yi-fan-song"
							>github readme</a

						for the most up to date list of the list of things I
						believe I am proefficient in.

				<h1>Things I made</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Lots of mistakes, that's usually the quickest way to
							learn.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							<a href="https://github.com/yi-fan-song/Shinsengumi"
								>Shinsengumi</a
							>
						</h2>
						<p>
							Shinsengumi is a moderation bot that I use for my
							Discord server. It is built with Typescript, because
							I have a strong negative opinion on Javascript
							because of its weakly typed nature. It uses a set of
							containers to run in a isolated environment from its
							host server. It uses mysql as the database engine in
							order to persist its state when it does inevitably
							crash. I originally planned to use deno as the
							runtime, but at the time, its Discord api library
							was not as complete as Discord.Js.
						</p>
						<p>Techstack: Typescript, Node, Mysql, Docker</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/yi-fan-song/space-kraken"
								>Space-kraken</a
							>
						</h2>
						<p>
							Space-kraken is a client that plays the game
							<a href="https://spacetraders.io/">Space Traders</a
							>. I built it originally to combine gaming and
							programming, but it was just a fight against the
							clock to implement a working client before the API
							has breaking updates, so I seldom work on it when I
							have a large amount of time to spend.
						</p>
						<p>Techstack: Golang</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/yi-fan-song/format-copy-for-firefox"
								>Format-copy-for-firefox</a
							>
						</h2>
						<p>
							Format-copy-for-firefox is one of those tools I
							built for myself, I use it to copy youtube links
							with a prefix to copy paste into a Discord channel
							to issue a command to a bot to play music. If I ever
							get around to it, it might also be useful to let me
							copy multiple links and paste them all at once
							instead of scrolling through ditto. <br />
							If only I've search a bit before making it, it's
							always been made like 50 times. I guess this was a
							good excuse to learn how to make firefox extensions.
						</p>
						<p>Techstack: Javascript</p>

				<h1>Things I like</h1>
				<p>
					Of course, I do things other than programming or spending an
					entire day trying to get a program to work in my
					environment.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Anime/Manga</h2>
						<p>
							I tend to consume manga more often than anime,
							because it is just much more convenient and faster.
							My taste are pretty varied but my favorite manga is
							<a
								href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/70345/Grand_Blue"
								>Grand Blue Dreaming</a
							>. See
							<a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/SirSoDerp"
								>my anime list</a
							>
							or my
							<a
								href="https://mangadex.org/user/18958f58-70d1-4c29-8e7c-b541da966adf"
								>mangadex list</a
							>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Video Games</h2>
						<p>
							I used to be a huge FPS player, playing Battlefield
							3-4, CS:GO and Overwatch. Nowadays, I try to find
							some relaxing games like Minecraft, World of Tanks,
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Vtubers</h2>
						<p>
							Watching vtubers is a very fun past-time I
							discovered as the covid-19 pandemic started (around
							march 2020). I mostly watch hololive or other
							Japanese vtubers as I am not very fond of the Twitch
							culture, that in my opinion, can felt in the streams
							of most English speaking vtubers.
						</p>
						<p>
							My favorite Vtubers are
							<a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqm3BQLlJfvkTsX_hvm0UmA"
								>Tsunomaki Watame</a
							>
							and
							<a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMwGHR0BTZuLsmjY_NT5Pwg"
								>Ninomae Ina'nis</a
							>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Gacha Games</h2>
						<p>
							I put Gacha Games in another category because my
							opinion is that Gacha Gaming is not quite the same
							as playing a traditional video game like Super Mario
							64. I play Azur Lane, Arknights, Blue Archive (a big
							Yostar fanboy).
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Things I think</h1>
				<p>
					My website is ultra light and simple because I've once read
					<a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"
						>a rant on overdesigning websites</a
					>
					and I agree with lots of the points brought up, and the
					simpler a website is, the easier it is to make it accessible
					by following the
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/"
						>Web Accessiblity Iniatiative (WAI) guidelines</a
					>. Also, I am not going to spend countless hours trying to
					make a fancy looking website just to learn some random
					animation library that will have no use besides looking nice
					when you have javascript turned on and don't mind loading a
					massive library.
				</p>
				<p>
					I suppose this would also contain a list of recent blogs if
					I ever decide to blog. [WIP]
